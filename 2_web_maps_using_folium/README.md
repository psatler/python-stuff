# Web maps with Python and Folium

- Map of the volcanoes in the USA. There are markers in the map indicating where the volcane is located, as well as its elevation. Markers are clustered, so when the map is zoomed out or in, the clusters fold or unfold.
- Map of unemployment rate of USA using a Choropleth kind of map.
